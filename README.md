<strong>Examples:</strong>

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebSearchWithElasticsearch">Simple autocomplete search </a>

This examples shows how to do a simple search using an MVC application with jQuery autocomplete and Elasticsearch simple documents . 

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebSearchWithElasticsearchNestedDocuments">Using with NESTED documents (NEST for search)</a>

This example uses Elasticsearch nested documents. The documents can be created, deleted, updated or searched for. The autocomplete search searches the documents as well as the nested objects.

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebSearchWithElasticsearchChildDocuments">Elasticsearch child, parent documents in a MVC application</a>

This example uses Elasticsearch child/parent documents. All documents are saved inside the same index each with a different type. The child and parent documents are saved on the same shard. It is possible to do CRUD operations with all child documents or search for child/parent documents.

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/DataTransferSQLWithEntityFrameworkToElasticsearch">Data Transfer MS SQLServer 2014 With EntityFramework To Elasticsearch</a>

This examples show how to transfer entities to documents in Elasticsearch. The entities are saved as nested documents.

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebSearchWithElasticsearchEntityFrameworkAsPrimary">MVC application with Entity Framework and Elasticsearch</a>

This example demonstrates how to use Entity Framework as you primary database and Elasticsearch for the search in an MVC application. The application needs to create, update, delete documents in the search engine when ever Entity Framework changes, deletes or updates an entity.

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/LiveReindexInElasticsearch">Live Reindexing in Elasticsearch</a>

This example shows how to do a live reindex in Elasticsearch. There is no downtime. The old index is accessed using an alias. The new index is created from the old index using scan and scroll and a document mapper. Then the alias to switched to access the new index. Then if required, the old index could be removed.

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebApiCSVExportFromElasticsearch">Web API CSV Export using Elasticsearch (scan and scroll)</a>

This example shows how to export data from Elasticsearch ( _search scan and scroll) to Web API as a CSV file (using WebApiContrib.Formatting.Xlsx). The export is displayed in real time using SignalR. The example also provides a SignalR TraceProvider for ElasticsearchCRUD.

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/ElasticsearchCRUD/tree/master/ConsoleElasticsearchCrudExample">ConsoleElasticsearchCrudExample</a>

A basic CRUD example.

<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/ElasticsearchCRUD/tree/master/ElasticsearchCRUD.Integration.Test">ElasticsearchCRUD.Integration.Test</a>

The integration tests shows lots of examples for ElasticsearchCRUD.

Example showing mapping configuration.
